.vs/
bin/
obj/
*.user
*.suo
*.cache
*.log
*.dbmdl
*.jfm
*.vscode/
*.env
Save it.

3️⃣ Remove .vs folder from Git cache (so it’s no longer tracked)
Run these commands:

bash
Copy code
git rm -r --cached .vs
git add .
git commit -m "Removed .vs folder and added .gitignore"
4️⃣ Then continue your workflow
bash
Copy code
git push origin main
(or master, depending on your branch)

✅ After this:
Your Git repo will only contain code — not temporary IDE junk.
You’ll never face this .vs permission denied issue again.

Would you like me to give you a complete .gitignore specifically for .NET + Visual Studio + Clean Architecture project setup (so nothing unnecessary ever gets pushed)?
